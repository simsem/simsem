Specifying the missing template to impose on a dataset
}
\description{
Specifying the missing template (\code{\linkS4class{SimMissing}}) to impose on a dataset. The template will be used in Monte Carlo simulation such that, in the \code{\link{sim}} function, datasets are created and imposed by missing values created by this template. See \code{\link{imposeMissing}} for further details of each argument.
}
\usage{
miss(cov = 0, pmMCAR = 0, pmMAR = 0, logit = "", nforms = 0, itemGroups = list(),
     timePoints = 1, twoMethod = 0, prAttr = 0,
     convergentCutoff = 0.8, ignoreCols = 0,
     threshold = 0, covAsAux = TRUE, logical = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
	\item{cov}{Column indices of any normally distributed covariates used in the data set.}
    \item{pmMCAR}{Decimal percent of missingness to introduce completely at random on all variables.}
    \item{pmMAR}{Decimal percent of missingness to introduce using the listed covariates as predictors.}
	\item{logit}{The script used for imposing missing values by logistic regression. The script is similar to the specification of regression in \code{lavaan} such that each line begins with a dependent variable, then '~' is used as regression sign, and the formula of a linear combination of independent variable plus constant, such as y1 ~ 0.5 + 0.2*y2. '#' and '!' can be used as a comment (like \code{lavaan}). For the intercept, users may use 'p()' to specify the average proportion of missing, such as y1 ~ p(0.2) + 0.3*y2, which the average missing proportion of y1 is 0.2 and the missing of y1 depends on y2. Users may visualize the missing proportion from the logistic specification by the \code{\link{plotLogitMiss}} function.}
    \item{nforms}{The number of forms for planned missing data designs, not including the shared form.}
    \item{itemGroups}{List of lists of item groupings for planned missing data forms. Without this, items will be divided into groups sequentially (e.g. 1-3,4-6,7-9,10-12)}
    \item{timePoints}{Number of timepoints items were measured over. For longitudinal data, planned missing designs will be implemented within each timepoint.}
    \item{twoMethod}{With missing on one variable: vector of (column index, percent missing). Will put a given percent missing on that column in the matrix to simulate a two method planned missing data research design. With missing on two or more variables: list of (column indices, percent missing). }
	\item{prAttr}{Probability (or vector of probabilities) of an entire case being removed due to attrition at a given time point. See \code{\link{imposeMissing}} for further details.}
  \item{m}{The number of imputations (DEPRECATED). The only currently accepted value is 0, indicating to use full information maximum likelihood estimation.}
  \item{convergentCutoff}{DEPRECATED. If the proportion of convergent results across imputations are greater than the specified value (the default is 80\%), the analysis on the dataset is considered as convergent. Otherwise, the analysis is considered as nonconvergent. This attribute is applied for multiple imputation only (currently not supported). }
  \item{ignoreCols}{The columns not imposed any missing values for any missing data patterns}
	\item{threshold}{The threshold of covariates that divide between the area to impose missing and the area not to impose missing. The default threshold is the mean of the covariate.}
	\item{covAsAux}{If \code{TRUE}, the covariate listed in the object will be used as auxiliary variables when putting in the model object. If \code{FALSE}, the covariate will be included in the analysis.}
	\item{logical}{A matrix of logical values (\code{TRUE/FALSE}). If a value in the dataset is corresponding to the \code{TRUE} in the logical matrix, the value will be missing.}
	\item{\dots}{DEPRECATED. Additional arguments passed to a multiple-imputation function (no longer supported).}

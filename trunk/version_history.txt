	*The attributes of this class are data, free parameters, parameter value underlying the data, parameter value + misspecification underlying the data, and equality constraint.

- summaryParam-SimResult.c is modified to provide average parameter values, standard deviation of parameter values, average bias, standard deviation of bias, percentage coverage, relative bias, relative bias of SE, and standardized bias. Last three is provided if setting detail=TRUE.
- summaryParam documentation file is modified accordingly.
- SimModelOut.c and SimResult.c are changed to have paramValue attributes.

- Update the vignette by explaining the output from summary.f 
- Bug fixes in create.free.parameters.f, simSetCFA.f, simSetPath.f, simSetSEM.f that did not free error variances and measurement intercepts when using default.
- Change the name of constant.vector.f --> constantVector.f
- Add freeVector.f to create vector of free parameters with starting values.
% Existing Problem: In SEM model, total endogenous factor variances are fixed as 1 in data model but, instead, residual factor variances are fixed as 1 in the estimation. Therefore, high bias in factor loading and measurement error variances in endogenous side. Change in parameter values are needed. (Fixed by the standardize method 03/05/12)


Note
*.f = function
*.c = class

        <h1>simsem: SIMulated Structural Equation Modeling</h1>

<p>This R package has been developed for facilitating simulation and analysis of data within the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. This package aims to help analysts create simulated data from hypotheses or analytic results from obtained data. The simulated data can be used for different purposes, such as power analysis, model fit evaluation, and planned missing design.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Building simulated sampling distribution for fit indices.</em> This package will help researchers tailor fit indices cutoffs based on a priori alpha level and a priori definition of trivial model misspecification. In other words, this package will help researchers simulate data based on their actual model with their defined trivial model misspecification. Then, the fit indices from the simulated data can be used to create empirical sampling distributions and find the fit indices cutoff based on the sampling distributions. Model parameters can be specified manually or obtained from the results of data analysis. If model parameters are obtained from the results of data analysis, this approach is also called the parametric bootstrap or Monte Carlo approach. The Bollen-Stine bootstrap approach for data generation is also available, as well as creating nonnormal distribution by Gaussian copula. </li>
<li><em>Power analysis.</em> This package will help analysts find power of both parameter estimates and model evaluation. This package can find power when data are missing. Missing data imposed into simulated data can be 1) missing completely at random (MCAR), 2) missing at random (MAR), 3) missing not at random (NMAR), and 4) planned missing data (<em>n</em>-form design or two-method design). Longitudinal missing data (i.e., attrition) can be modeled as a MCAR or MAR process. Missing data can be handled through multiple imputation of Full Information Maximum Liklihood. Sample size and percent missing can be varied continuously and power plots given values of sample size or percent missing can be built.</li>
<li><em>Methodological investigations.</em> This package can be used for methodological studies concerning SEM. Researchers can easily vary parameter values and model misspecification across parameters and easily summarize results from simulations. Nested models can be easily tested by comparing the results from two simulation runs. The powerful and flexible missing data options available in simsem make the package extremely useful in methodological investigations concerning SEM and missing data.</li>

</ol><h2>Announcements</h2>

<h3>[March 17, 2013] Latest Update: simsem, Version 0.5-3</h3>

<p>This version is available on CRAN and KRAN. This simulation result of this version can save confidence interval computed by any methods (e.g., bootstrap or profile-likelihood). The coverage rate can be investigated by <strong>getCoverage</strong>, <strong>findCoverage</strong>, and <strong>plotCoverage</strong> functions. The confidence interval widths can be investigated by <strong>getCIwidth</strong> and <strong>plotCIwidth</strong>, which allows users to estimate sample size and percent missing for accuracy in parameter estimation. The <strong>inspect</strong> function is written to extract the information from the simulation result, such as <strong>inspect(Output, "fit")</strong> for fit indices of convergent replications. The <strong>summaryTime</strong>, <strong>summarySeed</strong>, and <strong>coef</strong> are also written to extract information from the simulation result. The <strong>empirical</strong> argument is added into the <strong>generate</strong> and <strong>createData</strong> functions to create multivariate normal data with the sample statistics equal to the model-implied means and covariance matrix from the provided parameters.</p>

<h3>[March 9, 2013] Latest Update: simsem, Version 0.5-2</h3>

<p>This version is available on KRAN. The major update in this function is that users can write a function that returns vectors of parameter estimates, standard errors, fit indices, and convergence status and specify it in the <em>model</em> argument in the <strong>sim</strong> function. See the help page of the <strong>sim</strong> function for an example. A minor bug in multiple group analysis was fixed.</p>

<h2>Program</h2>

<p>The project is still under development. The package can be installed by copying this line into R:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages("simsem")
</code></pre>

<p>If you are interested in the source code, please click <a href="https://github.com/simsem/simsem">here</a>.</p>

<p>You may install the recently developed test version from KRAN (KU R Archive Network) by 1) making sure that you have the <strong>lavaan</strong> and <strong>copula</strong> packages in your personal library, and 2) copying this line into R:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages("simsem", repos="http://rweb.quant.ku.edu/kran", type="source")
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how to install simsemClassic (version 0.2-8 of simsem) from KRAN only:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages("simsemClassic", repos="http://rweb.quant.ku.edu/kran", type="source")
</code></pre>

If users wish to use the <strong>OpenMx</strong> package for data generation or data analysis, please follow this <a href="http://openmx.psyc.virginia.edu/">link</a> to check the download instruction.
